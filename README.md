Procedure:

	1.	Define A/B test objective: Determine the goal, e.g., higher email open rates.
	2.	Create two email variations with different subject lines: “Sale ends soon! Don’t miss out on 20% off!” and “New arrivals just in! Get them before they’re gone.”
	3.	Randomly divide 500 subscribers into two groups of 250 each.
	4.	Simultaneously send both email variations to their respective groups.
	5.	Analyze results in Google Analytics by comparing open rates.
	6.	Draw conclusions and apply insights to future email campaigns for continuous improvement.
	7.	Monitor User Interaction: Keep a keen eye on user interactions post-email delivery. Track clicks, opens, and any other engagement metrics to capture a holistic view of the audience response.
	8.	Segment Analysis: Dive deeper into Google Analytics by segmenting data based on user demographics, locations, or devices. This nuanced analysis provides valuable insights into specific audience preferences.
	9.	Iterative Testing: Email optimization is an ongoing process. Utilize iterative testing by periodically revisiting subject lines, content, or visuals to adapt to evolving audience behaviors and preferences.
